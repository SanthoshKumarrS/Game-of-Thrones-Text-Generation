# Game-of-Thrones-Text-Generation :
I worked on a Text Generation project using the Game of Thrones book dataset in this repository

# 📝 Description :

This is a traditional text generation issue that makes use of passages from well-known literature, in this case, Game of Thrones. Research on open-ended language models is currently popular, and this has led to the development of deep learning models with unique design. The first several chapters of the Classic Game of Thrones Book are included in this problem. The creation of text for this corpus would assist in the creation of fictitious corpora for AI.

# 🧭 Problem Statement:

You are provided with got1: you have to perform a step-by-step NLP approach to generate text based on input from any part of the book. A reference to performing the task has been attached below.

# Steps Taken :

👉 Loading dataset

👉 Data Preparation

👉 Tokenization and vectorization

👉 Building a Deep learning model (LSTM) to predict the next word from the sequences

👉 Model has high loss

👉 Finetuning with gpt2

👉 Results have low losses
